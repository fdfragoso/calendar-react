## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
<h3 align="center"> This is an assigment for a front end developer job interview. The goal was to create a calendar with reminders. To do it was required to program with React and Redux.</h3>.
In each date there is a plus signal, where the user can click it and the fileds to type the reminder show up on the clicked date. The user can type a reminder, date, time. Besides this it can get the forecast from a place and change the reminder color.
All the reminders can be deleted or edited.

This was a maximum of 3 days of work. I started with calendar and after splited in different components using redux. Initially I tried to add the reminder using modal, but I decided to go with a simpler apporach so I was able to finish the task, but with more time I would like to:

- Use SCSS (I had troubles to proper compile it, tried solution on the webconfig, but this drained my time and I had to go with something else);
- Added drag and drop to the reminders
- Reminder inside a modal or popup style of google calendar
- A better redux structure
- More QA

## 🔧 Features<a name = "features"></a>

- The user can add a reminder - of max 30 chars - for day, time, place, weather and a color;
- Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order;
- Display the selected color on the reminder;
- Handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date, this one needed some fix
